chatGPT explanation of Thread Safe, Multi-Thread and Synchronized:

Thread Safe
Thread safety refers to the property of an object or a piece of code that guarantees safe execution by
multiple threads at the same time without leading to unexpected outcomes or corrupting shared data.

Real-life example:
Imagine a bank account that can be accessed by multiple ATMs. If the account is thread-safe,
it means that even if multiple ATMs try to update the account balance simultaneously, the updates will
happen correctly without any data corruption. For instance, if two people withdraw money at the same time,
the system will ensure that both transactions are processed in a way that the final balance reflects both
withdrawals accurately.

Multi-Thread
Multi-threading refers to a programming concept where multiple threads are spawned by a process to execute
tasks concurrently. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of applications.

Real-life example:
Consider a restaurant kitchen where multiple chefs (threads) work simultaneously to prepare different
parts of a meal. One chef is chopping vegetables, another is cooking the meat, and another is preparing
the sauce. Each chef works independently but together they complete the meal faster than if one chef were
doing all the tasks sequentially.

Synchronized
Synchronization is a technique used to control access to shared resources in concurrent programming.
It ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time, preventing data corruption and
ensuring thread safety.

Real-life example:
Imagine a bathroom in a house with multiple family members. To avoid conflicts and ensure privacy,
they use a lock on the bathroom door (synchronization). When someone is using the bathroom, they lock the door.
Others must wait until the person finishes and unlocks the door before they can use it.
This way, the bathroom is accessed in a controlled manner, ensuring no two people use it simultaneously.

Combining Concepts
To illustrate how these concepts work together, let's use the example of a shared printer in an office:

Multi-threading: Multiple employees (threads) send print jobs to the printer simultaneously.
Thread-safe: The printer's software is designed to handle multiple print jobs at once without
                mixing up the pages or losing any print jobs.
Synchronized: The printer uses a queue (synchronized resource) to manage the print jobs.
                Each job is processed one at a time, ensuring that only one print job is being
                printed at any moment, while others wait their turn in an orderly fashion.
