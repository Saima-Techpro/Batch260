    Task 1: use nested TERNARY

    Ask user to enter a password

            If the initial of the password is uppercase
          Check if it is 'A' or not.
          If it is 'A' the output will be "Valid Password"
          otherwise the output will be "Invalid Password"
          For example; Ali ==> Valid password    -    Mark ==> Invalid

           If the initial of the password is lowercase
          Check if it is 'z' or not.
          If it is 'z' the output will be "Valid Password"
          otherwise the output will be "Invalid Password"
          For example; zoe ==> Valid password  -   john ==> Invalid


          Task 2: Use  nested If Statement and nested Ternary both

     Type code to check the password
     If it has more than 8 characters, initial should be 'i'
     If it has no more than 8 characters initial should be 'K'
     Solve the task by using nested-ternary

     Hint: length() method is used to count the length of a String
